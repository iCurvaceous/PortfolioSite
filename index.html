		<p class="bio">What's up! I am Alexandra and I love to create games for others who need to have a unique experience they have never had before. I am very passionate about game design, but I am also very passionate about programming them. Games have surrounded me my entire life; from my childhood to my current everyday pass time. Both my parents were gamers (PC, console and hand-held). As a result, my brother and I grew up with games as a part of our lifestyle. My love for games has inspired me to also make similar experiences for others that relate to the fun I had in my childhood. My pursuit to develop games has driven me to attain my Associates in Science Degree - Game Development and Simulation Programming (VDVA) at New England Institute of Technology (NEIT). Aside from being self-taught, I have used the knowledge gained there to harness my skills as a game developer in hopes to become more successful in my dreams to create better games.
