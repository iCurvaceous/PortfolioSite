		<p class="bio-p">I'm not the average pretty young lady in her early 20's. <b>I was born to play games</b>, <i>literally.</i> My gamer parents introduced console games, hand held games and even computer games when I was really young. Anime shows such as DBZ, Yugioh, Pokemon and Sailormoon was the norm. I thought school was too easy back then that I was self-taught in Photoshop since I was 9 years old.( If you would like to look at the art I draw in my free time, then click this link to visit my <a target="_blank" href="http://karameli.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt Page</a>). I was ranking top 15 in my territory in grades. I realized I had a talent and started drawing at the age of 11. I graduated high school at 16 and then I experienced tough financial situations with my family and I also realized I didn't know what I wanted to actually do. Everything was a hobby for me and I could not have seen any of it as a job career back then. I went to college in general studies to try to figure out what I wanted to do. I tried learning psychology but it wasn't what I really wanted despite my love to help others.

		<p class="bio-p">I had a child, and thought that I probably wouldn't gain anything more other than selling my artwork, but <i>something</i> was calling me. I wanted to <em>live the dream</em> of creating something meaningful and beautiful. I wanted a challenge that would make me hit hard or go home. Being originally from the Virgin Islands, it was hard for others to be open-minded to the thought of me studying a field in game design, but I remembered when I played games. I reminisced about the feeling of when playing a game, how much I thought how many aspects of the game could be better. I was reminded of the memories how video games brought my siblings and I together. <strong>That's when I knew that Video Game Design was for me.</strong>
